To run this application, you need a MongoDB connect URI.

Once you have obtained the URI, create a file named ".env" in the root directory with the following content:

-   MONGO_URI=<your_uri>
-   Where <your_uri> is your connect URI

After that run the following command:

-   npm i
-   npm start

Finally, navigate to http://localhost:3000
